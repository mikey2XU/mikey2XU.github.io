      Version control is a system that saves and denotes changes to, in our case, code. Version control software like git enables individuals or groups to work on a singular program over multiple sessions of that program. These pieces may be edited and changed before being merged back into the original code. The advantages of employing Version control include aiding the debugging process, implementing changes without stepping on others’ code, and saving all versions and changes for later use.

        Git tracks changes in three steps, first files are added, then staged, and finally committed. Each step in the process is recorded in git and implemented through the terminal. In the first step a new file or change is implemented, once the change is made it is staged to be committed. This requires the ‘git add’ command after which the file may be committed using the ‘git commit’ command. With the commit is a commit message that describes the change made. All the steps may be viewed as a log and the status of git tracking may be viewed with the command ‘git status’.

        Github can store code remotely so that multiple users can access, edit, and merge to one convenient master branch. Github not only functions as a host for repositories but also as a collaborative and social environment with tools that enable users to access relevant information and network with co-contributors.
