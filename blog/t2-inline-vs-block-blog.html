      Inline, Block, and Inline-Block all refer to how contents are displayed and positioned on a web page. Specifically they are the methods employed in CSS to create the desired look. 
 
    </p>
    <p>
       Elements with the block property occupy  the page and do not allow any other contents to touch them. They effectively use an entire space as a singular element. The user inputs a height and width to outline the size of the block.

    </p>
    <p>
        Elements with the Inline property, on the other hand, do not require the user to input dimensions and they function, unlike a block, next to other elements. 
    <p>
    	Inline-Blocks allow students to input specific dimensions like one would for blocks while also having permission to touch other elements.
