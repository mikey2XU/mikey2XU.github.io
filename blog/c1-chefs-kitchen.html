    <p>
      I am beginning to understand that DBC is not a set of consumable skills and accreditations, instead it is an experience. I expect that DBC will be a simultaneously humbling and empowering experience. I am going to discard my ‘restaurant’ approach to learning and instead pursue the path of deliberate improvement through trial and failure. My expectations for DBC have changed in that I am no longer exclusively and explicitly hoping to gain proficiency in Ruby instead I intend to realize a much more amorphous and a-concrete goal. That is to find confidence and pride in what I can learn to create and allow my developing skills to illuminate where I’ll apply them in the future. I am very eager to be a part of the DBC community and participate in a learning environment where the attitude is less about personal achievement and more about communal growth. I once read that excitement and nervousness both register the same physical symptoms as both emotions relate to excess unspent energy burgeoning and waiting for release. I am simultaneously nervous and excited to begin this experience, as I can look forward to the knowledge and experience I will gain yet I also harbor the persistent fear that  I am not good enough compared to others. I am afraid that it takes too long for things to ‘click’ and that for me in the past true mastery has been a challenge to long and frustrating to achieve. I will set aside my fears and replace them with a confidence in my person, I’m sure with persistence I can be successful.
