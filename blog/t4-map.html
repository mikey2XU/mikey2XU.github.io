      map gives you a new aray with the modifications of a code block that is applied to each individual element within that array. 

    </p>
    <p>
     The map method will run every element contained in an array through the block of code provided. This means that the map method always returns an array with the exact same number of elements as the array teh method was applied to. 

     syntax: array:map { |array_stuff_to_modify| astm + 1} 
     [1, 2, 3]
     #=>
     [2, 3, 4]
