     Arrays are an index of objects which may represent other objects they are formatted similarly to a lists. An array can store a large quantity of objects in and order with each object having a number associated with it. Objects are ordered 0, 1, 2... etc and each number coresponds to a place (empty or full) in the array. 
 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hashes, like Arrays, are indecies of objects including strings, intergers, etc however they are organized using a key-value system in which a key, an alpha-numerical string, is associated with a value (oject). The key, like the 0, 1, 2 etc intergers of an array alligns with a particular element within the hash.

    </p>
    <p>
     Hashes may be understood as more complex forms of arrays that accept unique keys rather than a fixed set of integers.
