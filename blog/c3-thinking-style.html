     I am an Abstract-Random thinker. I was not at all surprised to learn this when I performed the test. The Mind Styles sheet alligns closely to my actual prefernces as a learner. I know that if I cannot relate to the other people I am involved with I'll be far less successful or likely to engage. My mind enjoys soaking up large and varied pieces of information at once, generally disregaurding specific details, and then recalling what I can synthesize from my pull. This means the learning process involves a lot of error for me, but eventually I build a complete and comprehensive undertsanding. I also would echo the Mind Styles 'what's hard for them' section, especially the giving exact details bullet. I have trouble recalling percisely what I am refering to or what I am doing but I can, non the less, do it anyways. I am more general process oriented than detailed and specific. This leads to teh creation of a lot of 'careless' error when I work.
