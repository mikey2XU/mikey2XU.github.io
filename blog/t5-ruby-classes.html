     Companies today sell information. Data, specifically 'Big Data', supposedly informs companies about the market's conditions, consumer's trends, and what they should invest in next whether they sell adverts, apps, or alt rock. The issuse is that analyzing data, big, small, local, or worldwide does not always lead to accurate or useful predictors of he future. Big data is not always smart data. As more and more of the tech industry relies on collecting packaging and reselling data for infrmatics and analysis it may become clear that the value of that information is inflated relative the ammount that exits and teh etent of its usefulness. Technologies that can analyze and predict things based on data must imprive tremendously should the valuation of data analytics retain its lofty appraisal. The technological improvement is ineveitable but pace is the issue.
